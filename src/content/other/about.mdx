### Hi, I'm Warren! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22-year-old developer at the National University of Singapore, deeply passionate about artificial intelligence. My work focuses on LLM fine-tuning, particularly exploring multimodal and efficient fine-tuning techniques.

I founded the AI Society at NUS and love building cool AI side projects in my free time. If you're interested in AI or want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!
